# About 

This is a grad school project I did right before the EURO '24 football competition. In short: the project recreates the 2019 paper of A.Groll (A hybrid random forest to predict soccer matches in international tournaments) adding some minor improvements, and then applies it to the EURO '24 tournament to get various predictions.

# More about

The work is contained in one notebook file - there can be found some theoretical explainations and code. There is also a pdf file that presents/discusses the final results.
